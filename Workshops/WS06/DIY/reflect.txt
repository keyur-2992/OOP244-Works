In Workshop 6, I gained valuable insights into essential C++ programming concepts. The focus on defining and implementing multiple constructors was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of object-oriented programming. Learning the rule of three highlighted the significance of proper memory management, emphasizing the importance of copy constructors, copy assignment operator overloads, and destructors. These components were crucial in preventing memory leaks and ensuring the integrity of the program. The workshop also provided a comprehensive understanding of reading and writing formatted data using istream and ostream. I grasped the intricacies of handling file input/output, including reading ifstream and overloading extraction and insertion operators. The utilization of istream as a parameter and understanding member functions like setstate() and peek() significantly enhanced my ability to manipulate input streams effectively. This workshop equipped me with a solid foundation in C++ I/O operations, enabling me to extract and insert data seamlessly.
